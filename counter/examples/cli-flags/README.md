# Command-Line Flags Example

## What it does

This example uses the `flag` package to define and parse command-line arguments.

## Why it matters

Command-line flags make your programs configurable and flexible. They’re ideal for things like ports, file paths, and debug modes.

## How it’s used in the project

In `go-counter`, flags are used to configure the HTTP server port, set the counter file path, and optionally enable debug logging at startup.
